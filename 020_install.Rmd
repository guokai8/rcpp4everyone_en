# Installation

Before developing with Rcpp, you need to install a C++ compiler.

## Install C++ compiler

### Windows

Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/index.html).

### Mac

Install Xcode command line tools. Execute the command `xcode-select --install` on Terminal.

### Linux

Install gcc and related packages. 

In Ubuntu Linux, execute the command `sudo apt-get install r-base-dev` on Terminal.


## Using other compilers installed by yourself

If you installed other compiler (g++, clang++) different from above, create the following file under the user's home directory. Then set environment variables in the file.

**Linux, Mac**

 - `.R/Makevars`

**Windows**

 - `.R/Makevars.win`

**Example settings of environmental variables**

```
CC=/opt/local/bin/gcc-mp-4.7
CXX=/opt/local/bin/g++-mp-4.7
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/local/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
CXXFLAGS= -g0 -O2 -Wall
MAKE=make -j4
```


## Install Rcpp

You can install Rcpp by executing the following code.

```r
install.packages("Rcpp")
```
