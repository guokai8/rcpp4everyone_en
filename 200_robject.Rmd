# RObject

The `RObject` type is a type that can be assigned to any type of object defined in Rcpp. If you do not know what type is passed to the variable at run time, you can use `RObject`.

## Member functions

`RObject` has the following member functions. These member functions also exist in all other API classes (such as `NumericVector`) in Rcpp.

### inherits(str)

Returns `true` if this object inherits the class specified by the string `str`.


### slot(name)

Accesses the slot specified by the character string `name` if this object is `S4`.

### hasSlot(name)

Returns `true` if there is a slot specified by the character string name.

### attr(name)

Accesses the attribute specified by the string `name`.


### attributeNames()

Return the names of all the attributes of this object as `std::vector<std::string>`.

### hasAttribute(name)

Returns `true` if this object has an attribute with the name specified by the string `name`.

### isNULL()

Returns true if this object is `NULL`.

### sexp_type()

Returns `SXPTYPE` of this object as `int`. See the [R internals](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#SEXPTYPEs) for a list of all `SEXPTYPE` defined in R.

### isObject()

Returns `true` if this object has a "class" attribute.


### isS4()

Return `true` if this object is a `S4` object.



## Determining type of object assigned to RObject

One useful use of `RObject` is to determine the type of the object. To determine which type the value assigned to `RObject`, use the `is<T>()` function or member function `isS4()` `isNULL()`.

However, matrices and factor vectors can not be determined by only using the function `is<T>()` because they are vectors with values are set to specific attribute. To determine them, use `Rf_isMatrix()` function or the `Rf_isFactor()` function.

The code example below shows how to determine the type using `RObject`.

```cpp
// [[Rcpp::export]]
void rcpp_type(RObject x){
    if(is<NumericVector>(x)){
        if(Rf_isMatrix(x)) Rcout << "NumericMatrix\n";
        else Rcout << "NumericVector\n";       
    }
    else if(is<IntegerVector>(x)){
        if(Rf_isFactor(x)) Rcout << "factor\n";
        else Rcout << "IntegerVector\n";
    }
    else if(is<CharacterVector>(x))
        Rcout << "CharacterVector\n";
    else if(is<LogicalVector>(x))
        Rcout << "LogicalVector\n";
    else if(is<DataFrame>(x))
        Rcout << "DataFrame\n";
    else if(is<List>(x))
        Rcout << "List\n";
    else if(x.isS4())
        Rcout << "S4\n";
    else if(x.isNULL())
        Rcout << "NULL\n";
    else
        Rcout << "unknown\n";
}
```

Use `as<T>()` to convert `RObject` to another Rcpp type after determining the type.


```cpp
// Converting `RObject` to `NumericVector`
RObject x;
NumericVector v = as<NumericVector>(x);
```

## Using `RObject` to write functions that receive various datatypes (function templates)

C++ allows us to avoid code duplication by writing [templated functions](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/templates) that are not limited to specific datatypes. 

**Note:** This section does not cover C++ templates in any detail - it only shows how to implement them in Rcpp. It also assumes your compiler can use C++11 syntax. If not, please refer to [this Rcpp Gallery example](https://gallery.rcpp.org/articles/rcpp-return-macros/) by Nathan Russell which covers the process in much more detail (and which provided the source material for this section). 

Say we have a very simple C++ templated function that prints "Hello" and then returns its input.

```cpp
template<typename T>
T say_hello(T x) {
    std::cout << "Hello!" << std::endl;
    return x;
}
```

The `T` in this function is a placeholder for any other type. You can use any identifier you like, but `T` is conventional. At compile time the compiler analyses our code and creates new functions with `T` replaced with the relevant datatypes, so we don't have to write versions of `add_one()` for `int`, `float`, `double` etc.

In Rcpp the process is almost identical, but we have to jump through a couple of extra hoops.

A first attempt at an Rcpp version of the function might look very similar:

```cpp
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
template<typename T>
T say_hello(T x) {
    Rcout << "Hello!" << std::endl;
    return x;
}
```

However, this will not compile. To quote [Nathan Russell's article](https://gallery.rcpp.org/articles/rcpp-return-macros/):

> Sadly this does not work: magical as Rcpp attributes may be, there are limits to what they can do, and at least for the time being, translating C++ template functions into something compatible with Râ€™s C API is out of the question.

Fortunately Rcpp provides two macros, `RCPP_RETURN_VECTOR` and `RCPP_RETURN_MATRIX` that make it very simple to implement a templated function.

```cpp
template<int RTYPE>
Vector<RTYPE> printer(Vector<RTYPE> x) {
    Rcout << "Hello!" << std::endl;
    return x;
}

// [[Rcpp::export]]
RObject say_hello(RObject x) {
    RCPP_RETURN_VECTOR(printer, x);
}
```

The exported `say_hello()` function now works as expected in R.

```R
say_hello("a")
## Hello!
##  [1] "a"

say_hello(1:10)
## Hello!
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

say_hello(FALSE)
## Hello!
##  [1] FALSE
```

Note that the template specification looks slightly different: `template<int RTYPE>` rather than `template<typename T>` in the earlier example. This is called a [non-type parameter](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/134-template-non-type-parameters/), and is used because [the type of an RObject is stored as an integer](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#SEXPTYPEs). Again, Nathan's article provides more details on this. As with the use of `T` in the first example, the use of `RTYPE` as an alias for the type is entirely arbitrary.

Also note that `printer()` and `say_hello()` have different names because otherwise the call to `RCPP_RETURN_VECTOR` is ambiguous and the code will not compile. If you would prefer both functions to have the same name, you can use [namespaces](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/namespace) as shown below.  

```cpp
namespace internal {

    template<int RTYPE>
    Vector<RTYPE> say_hello(Vector<RTYPE> x) {
        Rcout << "Hello!" << std::endl;
        return x;
    }
    
}  // end of "internal" namespace

// [[Rcpp::export]]
RObject say_hello(RObject x) {
    RCPP_RETURN_VECTOR(internal::say_hello, x);
}
```
