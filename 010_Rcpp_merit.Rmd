# Suitable situations to use Rcpp

R is weak in some kinds of operations. If you need operations listed below, it is time to consider using Rcpp.

- Loop operations in which later iterations depend on previous iterations.
- Accessing each element of a vector/matrix.
- Recurrent function calls within loops.
- Changing the size of vectors dynamically.
- Operations that need advanced data structures and algorithms.
